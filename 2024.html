          When you try to attend to something before life presents them to you (like pursuing a mate to fall in love with you, like wishing for things to happen to you), you are setting yourself for self inflicted misery and heartache.
        </li></br>

          Time Heals Eveything.

          I used to think that we have snatch things from the hand of fortune but in the end I realised that it is fate who actually presents you with its gifts. It is for you to take not snatch.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Each day brings its own gifts. Accept it.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Whatever happens to you , accept it and move on. Whatever life awards you , take it with a smile and accept it as your reward.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Refusal of a romantic proposal is painful and heartbreaking because it is the purest form of rejection of you. It literally is. 
          But remember, humans are bad at valuing things. And whatever you are going through millions have gone through and millions will go through. Just read Epictetus and do some daily walking, everything comes back to life . You become habitual and stop caring Those emotions eventually fade. Believe me they do as I and you will.

          Everything that belongs to us comes to us if and only if we build the capacity to receive it.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Right now you cant see how indulging in cheap pleaure will affect you for you want nothing, but I have realised that a human has to bear the consequences of his/her actions in this life itself.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          We create our fortunes and call it fate.
        </li></br>

          If you are at peace today, thank the lord for one day you wont be at peace and you will remember the hard but peaceful times.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The more pain you bear , the more deep is the well of your heart, the more the happiness you will feel when the dark clouds will fade away for they will one day believe me.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The relationships where two people take care of each other truly and you totally trust them and know that they love you, those are priceless.
          Surrender to those relationships for those are the rarest . Like your parents, your siblings, your mate etc.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Only after something is lost , you understand its value. Value everything you hold right now for beleive me tears will well up when its taken away and it will be , my friend.
          Deapair not, in return life will present another gift.

          I see all this drama of humans with a smile and then I tremble thinking I am a human too.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          I am always looking for friends in life who I can trust and they can trust me and we can be passangers in this journey of life. 
          Thats the real compounding that is needed. To have real friends who love you and you love you. Throughout the existence.

          The more I talk with guys I understand that boys in 1 to 1 conversations are the most kind emotional people . They listen to you and present to you with gifts. But beware of Boys in a group. They are devils as they have a reputation to keep.

          The reason you become emotionally attached to a person is because you believe that their companionship will make your life better.

          I want to build a life where I do actions out of love and not out of force / fear / greed.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The way to deal with sadness and heartache is to indulge yourself in productive positive activities (reading, walking ) and then try to cry out the tears which are stuck in your heart. Sounds strange aa ? Try it and then decide.

          Circumstances don't make the man, they only reveal him to himself.
