          When you try to attend to something before life presents them to you (like pursuing a mate to fall in love with you, like wishing for things to happen to you), you are setting yourself for self inflicted misery and heartache.
        </li></br>

          Time Heals Eveything.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          I used to think that in life, we have to snatch things from the hand of fortune but in the end I realised that it is fate who itself presents you with its gifts. It is within your power to only take with gratitude.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          What aadhar is actually looking in every situation in life is an audience to make them laugh.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Each day brings its own gifts. Accept it.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Whatever happens to you , accept it and move on. Whatever life awards you , take it with a smile and accept it as your reward. Everything is a blessing.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The refusal of a romantic proposal is painful and heartbreaking because it is the purest form of rejection. The rejection of you. It literally is. 
          But remember, humans are bad at valuing things. And whatever you are going through millions have gone through and millions will go through. 
        </li></br>

        <li>
          For dealing with sadness, read Epictetus and do some daily walking excercises, everything comes back to life . You become habitual and stop caring Those emotions eventually fade. Believe me they do as I and you will.
          Embrace your pain .your sorrow .Face it .Enjoy it .This is you .You in your rawest form . Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears. Its exciting because this experience will improve you somehow. 
        </li></br>
        <li>
          To bear this worthily is good fortune. 
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Everything that belongs to us comes to us if and only if we build the capacity to receive it.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Right now you cant see how indulging in cheap pleaure will affect you for you want nothing, but I have realised that a human has to bear the consequences of his/her actions in this life itself.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          We create our fortunes and call it fate.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          If you are at peace today, thank the lord for one day you wont be at peace and you will remember the hard but peaceful times.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The more pain you bear , the more deep becomes the well of your heart, the more becomes your capacity to feel the happiness.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The relationships where two people take care of each other truly and you totally trust them and know that they love you, those are priceless.
          Surrender to those relationships for those are the rarest . Like your parents, your siblings, your mate, your true friends etc.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Only after something is lost , you understand its value. Value everything you hold right now for beleive me tears will well up when its taken away and it will be , my friend.
          Despair not, in return life will present another gift.

          The more I talk with guys I understand that boys in 1 to 1 conversations are the most kind emotional people . They listen to you and present to you with gifts. But beware of Boys in a group. They are devils as they have a reputation to keep.

          The reason you become emotionally attached to a person is because you believe that their companionship will make your life better.

          I want to build a life where I do actions out of love and not out of force / fear / greed / money. Its the highest reward in itself to only work with people you are going to enjoy workingÂ with.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The way to deal with sadness and heartache is to indulge yourself in productive positive activities (reading, walking ) and then try to cry out the tears which are stuck in your heart. Sounds strange aa ? Try it and then decide.

          It is a great experience to fall in one sided love with a celebrity. 
          It is an equally heartbreaking experience to fall in love with someone you meet daily at work or school.

          Sophisticated foods are bittersweet (wine, beer, coffee, chocolate). Addictive relationships are cooperative and competitive. Work becomes flow at the limits of ability. The flavor of life isÂ onÂ theÂ edge. ~naval

          The idea of a perfect romance between a boy and a girl is so attractive because it gives a flight of fantasy away from the solvenly realities of life.
