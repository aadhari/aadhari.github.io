        <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCSZ9YK6FzE - In this the host asks shahrukh why he does not fool around with other young actresses , he said and I quote :
<b>"There is peaceful quality, an inherent calmness which Gauri has. I dont want to be responsible to take this peace away from her"</b>
I was stuneed at his words. At shahrukh's wisdom. I was always very intruiged how coming from simple Delhi family he was able to work with so many (not only beautiful but very high class) actresses like Kajol, Karishma , Rani, Juhi. And he always made them feel safe. Juhi and Shahrukh are still friends. This is not the norm. He had so much clarity at such a young age.</li>

        <b>You have to go and checkout old interviews of Raveena Tandon. She comes from a producer family but in some dark time , the way she dealt with a betrayal and how real she sprung back as a top actress and a top human being. This was display of real valueset and character. Commendable. I did not expect her to be such a gem . But she is .
